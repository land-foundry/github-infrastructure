# Engineering Restraint

Apply these principles to code, tests, documentation, configuration, and automation.

- **Every line is technical debt.** Add content only when it contributes to the requested outcome, clarity, correctness, or necessary validation. Remove unnecessary additions before completing the change. Do not compress useful content merely to reduce line count.
- **KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid.** Prefer the simplest understandable solution that meets demonstrated requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, options, extension points, and infrastructure.
- **DRY — Don't Repeat Yourself.** Reuse existing capabilities and maintain one authoritative source for each rule or piece of knowledge. Do not combine superficially similar concerns that need to evolve independently.
- **High cohesion.** Keep related responsibilities and information together. Each module, document, and change should have a clear purpose.
- **Low coupling.** Minimize dependencies, hidden assumptions, and changes that require unrelated components or documents to move together.

Before adding, inspect what already exists. Keep implementation within the requested scope. Before finishing, review the change for unnecessary structure, duplication, and content. Propose unrelated improvements separately.

Resolve tensions using correctness, understandability, and the requested outcome. Do not pursue any principle mechanically.

## Repository-Specific Guidance

This repository is retired after consolidation into land-foundry/platform-infrastructure under github/. Read README.md for the destination and migration guide. Preserve historical ADRs and do not restore an independent Terraform execution location here. Do not run terraform apply or terraform import. Source retirement and archival depend on the destination merge and verified state continuity.
